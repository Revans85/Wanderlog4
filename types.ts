 * have a bundler (like Vite or Webpack) to resolve imports between files.
 *
 * To make the application work, all component, hook, and service logic has
 * been consolidated into the main `index.tsx` file. This file is a duplicate
 * of that logic and its content has been commented out to avoid confusion.
